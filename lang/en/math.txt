eval.desc = Evaluate simple arithmetic expressions.\
Supports: \
* Basic operations (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `^`/`**`)\
* Functions (`ln`, `log`, `sqrt`/`√`)\
* Symbols (`e`, `pi`/`π`, `i`, `phi`/`φ`)\
* Factorial (`!`)

eval.error = Unable to evaluate {formulae}.
eval.error.KeyError = An unrecognized {0} operator is present: {1}
eval.error.TimeoutError = An power operator is too large: {0} ** {1}
eval.error.ArithmeticError = No such types of operation(s): {e}
eval.error.ValueError = An Operator doesn't have a 2nd operand.
